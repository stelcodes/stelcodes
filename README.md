### Introduction 👋

Hello! I'm Stel. I'm a software developer, musician, and more. A little bit about me...

- 💡 I'm a huge programming nerd. I often code for fun. I love Clojure(script), Python, JS, and Lua in particular.
- 🛠️ I love my tools. I'm obsessed with configuring. I use Neovim, Kitty, i3, and Sway on Fedora Linux for pretty much all my machines.
- 📖 Open source is rad. I love contributing to projects with issues, PRs, code review.
- 📫 You can reach me here: stel @ stel.codes
- 🌈 My pronouns are they/them. Trans rights are human rights!
