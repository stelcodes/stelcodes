### Introduction 👋

Hello! I'm Stel. I'm a software developer focused on building maintainable codebases. A little bit about me...

- 💡 I'm a huge computer nerd at heart. Always playing with languages like Clojure, Lua, Python, JS, S/CSS, SQL, Java...
- 🛠️ I love productivity tools. My favorite are Neovim, Kitty, and i3.
- I install Linux on everything I can. I use Debian as my daily driver alongside the Nix package manager.
- Open source is awesome. I love contributing to the open source projects that I use.
- 📫 You can reach me here: stel@stel.codes
- 🌈 My pronouns are they/them
