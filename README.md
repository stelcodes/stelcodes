### Introduction 👋

Hi I'm Stel. I love playing with computers. I started programming on my TI-84 in high school and never looked back.
💡 I'm a polyglot. I code in Clojure(script), Python, JS, Golang, Lua, Fennel, Nix, C++, Java, PHP...
🛠️ I love my tools. I use Neovim, Kitty, i3, and Sway on Fedora Linux for pretty much all my machines.
📖 Open source is rad. I love contributing to projects with code, issues, and review.
🌈 My pronouns are they/them. I'm very passionate about transgender people's right to exist in the world.
